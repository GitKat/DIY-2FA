    <h4>Verification Service</h4>
    <p>The example code is a simple PHP script implementing a verification service on top of Nexmo's API.
      <ul>
        <li>A number is traded for a hash.</li>
        <li>The verification service sends an SMS with a PIN to that number.</li>
        <li>That PIN is provided by the end user.</li>
        <li>Number, hash, and PIN are passed to the verification service to get the result.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Example Code?</h4>
    <p>If you're a developer, the provided example should be easy to take and modify to your needs. If you're not, you can find a <a href="">developer with Nexmo experience on oDesk</a>, and point them to this page.</p>

    <h4>Second Factor Authentication</h4>
    <p>Adding a second factor to a login system, in this case a mobile phone, increases security as a physical device is needed in addition to the username and password.</p>
    <p>For a web application, after validating a credential pair the application would request additional verification from a service similar to this example.</p>

    <h4>Number Ownership</h4>
    <p>Verifying that a user is the owner of a phone number is a common mobile application use case. On signup or install, the mobile application would collect the phone number. Then the application would use a service similar to this example to ensure the user owns the phone number.</p>
